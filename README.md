### Iteration 1:
# Eric Cheng's Contribution: 
- Focused on the Landing Page and Backlog page of the ScrumBoard Application. The landing page will allow you to route to certain pages of the application including the dashboard view Page, the backlog view Page, and the ability to create a dashbaord, which was a functionalty we decided to reuse. 
- Because the issuelist page becomes the backlog page, there was minimum changes on that end for iteration 1.0. 
- Having issues with importing images and css into the home page. Worked with a TA and thought it was a webpack versioning issue, but that did not resolve it. Still looking into this matter. Something related to the webpack.config.js
